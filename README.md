# Odin Ruby Project: Stock Picker
# https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker

This project is a classic intro to programming problem. It looks like it will 
test our knowledge of the various iterators for both arrays and hashes.

Description from Odin:
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
